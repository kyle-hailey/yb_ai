Analysis for Query 1:
--------------------------------------------------

Query Analysis:
Yes, this query contains a range predicate.

The range predicate is:

```sql
aid BETWEEN $1 AND $2 + $3
```

This clause uses the `BETWEEN` operator to filter rows where the value of the `aid` column falls within a specific range. The range's lower bound is the value of the parameter `$1`, and its upper bound is the result of the expression `$2 + $3`.

Explain Plan Analysis:
*   **Sequential Scans Found:** Yes.
*   **Affected Fields:** The `aid` column is affected. The explain plan shows a `Seq Scan` node on the `pgbench_accounts` table with a `Storage Filter` of `((pgbench_accounts.aid >= 100) AND (pgbench_accounts.aid <= 299))`. This filter corresponds directly to the `WHERE aid BETWEEN ...` range predicate in the SQL query.
*   **Recommended Index Creation Strategy:**
    Assuming `aid` is the primary key, two options can resolve the sequential scan:
    1.  **Recreate Table with RANGE Partitioning (Primary Key):** Modify the table's primary key to be range-partitioned. This is the most efficient option if range queries on `aid` are common.
        ```sql
        -- Example of recreating the table with a RANGE primary key
        CREATE TABLE pgbench_accounts (
            aid INT,
            bid INT,
            abalance INT,
            filler VARCHAR,
            PRIMARY KEY (aid ASC)
        );
        ```
    2.  **Create a Secondary RANGE Index:** If altering the primary key is not desirable, create a secondary `RANGE` index on the `aid` column.
        ```sql
        CREATE INDEX pgbench_accounts_aid_range_idx ON pgbench_accounts (aid ASC);
        ```
*   **Explanation of Why the Current Index is Not Sufficient:** The current primary key on `aid` is HASH-partitioned by default in YugabyteDB. A HASH index is optimized for point lookups (e.g., `WHERE aid = 123`) by distributing rows evenly across tablets. However, it does not store the data in a sorted order, making it unsuitable for range predicates (`BETWEEN`, `>`, `<`). Consequently, the database must perform a full sequential scan of the table and then filter the rows, which is inefficient for queries selecting a small range of data. A `RANGE` index is required to allow the database to directly seek to the start of the range and scan only the relevant rows.


**Existing Indexes:**

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pgbench_accounts_pkey ON public.pgbench_accounts USING lsm (aid HASH)
CREATE INDEX idx_abalance ON public.pgbench_accounts USING lsm (abalance HASH)
```

Analysis for Query 2:
--------------------------------------------------

Query Analysis:
Yes, the SQL query contains a range predicate.

The range predicate is:

`a.aid BETWEEN $1 AND $2 + $3`

This predicate uses the `BETWEEN` operator to select rows where the value of the `a.aid` column falls within the inclusive range defined by the parameter `$1` on the low end and the computed value of `$2 + $3` on the high end. This is equivalent to `a.aid >= $1 AND a.aid <= ($2 + $3)`.

Explain Plan Analysis:
**Analysis of Findings**

*   **Sequential Scans Found:** Yes.
*   **Affected Field and Table:** A sequential scan (`Seq Scan`) is performed on the `pgbench_accounts` table. The scan is filtered by a range predicate on the `a.aid` field, as shown by the `Storage Filter: '((a.aid >= 100) AND (a.aid <= 299))'`.
*   **Explanation of Insufficient Indexing:** The query uses a `BETWEEN` clause on `a.aid`, which is a range predicate. The plan uses a `Seq Scan` because there is no supporting `RANGE` index on the `a.aid` column. If `a.aid` is the primary key, it is HASH-partitioned by default in YugabyteDB. A HASH-partitioned index is efficient for point lookups (e.g., `WHERE aid = 123`) but cannot be used to efficiently scan a range of values, forcing the database to scan all rows to find those that match the filter.
*   **Recommended Index Creation Strategy:**
    Assuming `a.aid` is the primary key of the `pgbench_accounts` table, two options can resolve the sequential scan:

    1.  **Recreate the table with a RANGE partitioned primary key:** This is often the most efficient solution if range queries on `aid` are a primary access pattern.
        ```sql
        -- Example DDL
        CREATE TABLE pgbench_accounts (
            aid INT,
            bid INT,
            abalance INT,
            filler CHAR(84),
            PRIMARY KEY (aid ASC)
        );
        ```
    2.  **Add a secondary RANGE index:** If changing the primary key is not feasible, or to avoid potential write hotspots on a monotonically increasing key, create a secondary `RANGE` index on the `a.aid` column.
        ```sql
        CREATE INDEX pgbench_accounts_aid_range_idx ON pgbench_accounts (aid ASC);
        ```

Existing Indexes:
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pgbench_accounts_pkey ON public.pgbench_accounts USING lsm (aid HASH)
  CREATE INDEX idx_abalance ON public.pgbench_accounts USING lsm (abalance HASH)
